# Runs the Django development server, which is less than ideal in terms of
# replicating the deployment environment locally -- for which, the
# docker-compose-local.yml file is provided. However, due to lack of a good solution
# for static file development in a more deployment-like configuration, this
# current compose file is provided for development.

# web service mount to apps location so that development updates in the application
# are reflected in the container.
