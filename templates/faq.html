            <dd><p>A lot of the city hall documents are routine documents such as permits or extensions of recognition, congratulations, or gratitude. By default, City Hall Monitor will filter these documents from your search. If what you are looking for might be in some of those filtered documents, deselect "Ignore the boring stuff" when you search.</p>

            <dt id="city-hall-monitor-and-councilmatic">How is City Hall Monitor different from Councilmatic?</dt>
            <dd>
              <a href="https://chicago.councilmatic.org/">Councilmatic</a> is an excellent project which tries to "demystify" the Chicago City Council. City Hall Monitor (CHM) isn't meant to compete with it. City Hall Monitor, as a website, has provided a framework around which the Knight Lab team can develop familiarity with the corpus of Chicago City Council documents towards the bigger goal of developing document analysis methods. CHM also provides an opportunity for our community to keep up with current tools and best practices for building data-oriented websites.
